A simple Calculator Application written in Java that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division. This project demonstrates the use of Java OOP concepts like Method Overloading, Polymorphism, Exception Handling, along with control structures and user input handling using the Scanner class.

📌 Features ✅ Perform Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division 🔁 Method Overloading for different parameter types: Add two integers Add two doubles Add three integers ⚠️ Handles division by zero with proper exception handling 🧭 Interactive menu-driven interface 🧱 Clear, modular code structure — great for learning core OOP concepts in Java 🛠️ Tech Stack Language : Java IDE : VS Code 📚 Concepts Used ✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) ✅ Method Overloading (compile-time Polymorphism) ✅ Exception Handling (try-catch) ✅ Control Structures (Loops, switch-case) ✅ Scanner for reading user input 📸 Demo (Sample Run) Welcome to the Calculator Application!
